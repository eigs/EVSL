	EVSL TEST DRIVERS 
----------------------------------------

This  directory   provides a few   drivers  to   test  a   variety  of
situations. For convenience it is organized mostly by `method' with an
an additional directory devoted specifically to generalized problems.

Here are  the sub-directories included  [all drivers are  for standard
problems except those in GEN/]

PLanN  : Drivers  for testing the Polynomial filtering Lanczos method
         with No restarts 

PLanR  : Drivers  for testing the Polynomial filtering Lanczos method
         with Restarts

RLanN  : Drivers  for testing the Rational   filtering Lanczos method
         with No restarts

RLanR  : Drivers  for testing the Rational   filtering Lanczos method
         with Restarts

PSI    : Drivers  for testing the subspace iteration methods [polynomial 
         filtering only]

GEN    : Drivers for Generalized eigenvalue problems

Landos : Drivers for testing the estimation of spectral density 
         calculations by the Lanczos algorithm

COMMON : contains a number of functions that are called by many of the 
         drivers for standard problems (e.g. routines for reading matrices
         from files.. )

Fortran : contains drivers that test the wrappers for fortran 

----------------------------------------
 DRIVERS FOR STANDARD PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------

Lap*
 
 Drivers for testing a few  methods on simple Laplacean matrices.  You
 will also find here a driver for a matrix-free test whereby no matrix
 is passed  but the  matrix vector-product is  done via  function (and
 set-up as a function pointer).

MM*
 
 Drivers for testing a few  routines to compute eigenvalues of general
 sparse (symmetric real) matrices. These matrices are read from a file
 in  the matrix  market  format. Note:  The HB  matrix  format is  not
 supported.

----------------------------------------
 DRIVERS FOR GENERALIZED PROBLEMS
---------------------------------------- 

Gen/

  Test drivers  are for  testing  a  few routines for computing
  eigenvalues of general sparse (symmetric real) matrix pair (A, B),
  where B has to be positive definite. 
  
----------------------------------------
 DOS METHODS
----------------------------------------

Two methods for computing the  spectral density (aka density of state)
are used in  EVSL: KPM (the Kernel Polynomial Method)  and the Lanczos
method.  All drivers will use one  or the other.  The directory Landos
provides test drivers for the method based on the Lanczos method.


----------------------------------------
 Filtering
----------------------------------------
Two types of filtering are available

Rational
  
  Uses rational filtering. Built in includes embedded CXsparse. For
  better performance install SuiteSpasre and change the makefile.in
  accordingly

Polynomial
  
  Uses Chebyshev Polynomial filtering.


----------------------------------------
 OTHER 
---------------------------------------- 

Landos
 
 Drivers for  testing Density of  states routines. So far  the Lanczos
 method for DOS is tested.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are all drivers - by directory
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------ PLanN:

LapPLanN.c :   
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restarting Lanczos 

LapPLanN_MatFree.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restart Lanczos
    This example is to illustrate the use of Matrix-free solvers

MMPLanN.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restarting Lanczos
    make MMPLanN.ex--> executable MMPLanN.ex

------------------------------ PLanR:

LapPLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapPLanR.ex --> executable LapPLanR.ex

MMPLanR_omp.c : 
    same as MMPLanR.c but with openMP
    parallelization across slices
    make MMPLanR_omp.ex--> executable MMPLanR_omp.ex

MMPLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make MMPLanR.ex--> executable MMPLanR.ex

---------------------------------------- RLanN:

LapRLanN.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter non-restart Lanczos 
    make LapRLanN.ex --> executable LapRLanN.ex

MMRLanN.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter non-restarting Lanczos 
    make MMRLanN.ex--> executable MMRLanN.ex

---------------------------------------- RLanR

LapRLanR.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapRLanR.ex --> executable LapRLanR.ex

MMRLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make MMRLanR.ex--> executable MMRLanR.ex

---------------------------------------- PSI:

LapPSI.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Subspace Iteration
    make LapPSI.ex --> executable LapPSI.ex

MMPSI.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Subspace Iteration
    make MMPSI.ex--> executable MMPSI.ex

---------------------------------------- GEN

MMsimple.c A stripped down driver. Requires  no direct solves, and only requires
      the matrix (info entered in driver) and number of eigenvalues (61 in NM1A,
      the  default)  to  be  run.   Run as  ./MMsimple.ex.  Maintains  the  same
      structure  as the  other drivers  for easy  interoperability, while  still
      being composed of not-overly-complex code.

MMPLanN.c Pol. filtering Lanczos algorithm with no restarts
	  uses Lanczos for slicing
         ** Note: this driver tests the case when all operations with
          B are	  performed by a polynomial approximations - so no factorization
          is required.

MMPLanR.c Pol. filtering Lanczos algorithm with restarts
	  uses KPM for slicing

MMRLanN.c Rational filtering Lanczos algorithm with no restarts
	  uses Lanczos for slicing

MMRLanR.c Rational filtering Lanczos algorithm with no restarts
	  uses KPM for slicing

Drivers  that use  alternate spectrum  slicing for  each of  the above
drivers are  included in the  EXTRAS sub-directory. These  can replace
the corresponding  ones provided above if  the user wants to  test say
KPM vs. Lanczos for spectrum  slicing (e.g., KPM_MMRLanN.c will is the
same as MMRLanN.c above except that it uses KPM instead of Lanczos for
spectrum slicing).

LanDosG.c:  Density of States for a generalized eigenvalue problem (read from file)
