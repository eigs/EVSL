 This  directory contains  drivers for  testing spectral  density (aka
 Density of states) routines by the Lanczos algorithm. Both a standard
 eigenvalue  case (LanDos.c)  and  a generalized  one (LanDosG.c)  are
 provided.

LanDos.c   Density of States for a standard Laplacean by the Lanczos method
  By default shows the exact and computed DOS

LanDosG.c  Density of States for a generalized eigenvalue problem (read from file)
	   by the Lanczos method
  By default shows the computed DOS, use -graph_exact_dos 1 to show
  exact DOS (from precomputed eigenvalues)


 The .gnuplot files  are set-up for gnuplot invoked by  the drivers to
 show comparisons with exact spectral  densities.  The *.eps files are
 the plots produced by these drivers.
