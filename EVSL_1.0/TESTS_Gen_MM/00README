This directory  contains drivers for testing  a few routines
for computing eigenvalues of general sparse (symmetric real)
matrix pair (A, B), where B has to be positive definite. 
These matrices are read  from a file in the matrix
market format.  note: HB matrix format is not supported.

For  the rational  filter driver  you will  need to  link to
various modules  from the  SuiteSparse package. 

MMRLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make MMRLanR.ex--> executable MMRLanR.ex

MMRLanN.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter non-restarting Lanczos 
    make MMRLanN.ex--> executable MMRLanN.ex

            MM0: matrix format indexing starts at 0

io.c    : functions - in particular for reading matrices in mm format
mmio.c  : support functions for mm format [not all are needed] 

The computed eigenvalues are saved in OUT/ folder. 
 
Run:

./MM*.ex
