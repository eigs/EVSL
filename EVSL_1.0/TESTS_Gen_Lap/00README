These  drivers  are for  testing  a  few methods  on  simple
Laplacean matrix pair (A, B).

    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapPLanR.ex --> executable LapPLanR.ex

LapPLanN.c :   
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restarting Lanczos

LapRLanR.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart

To compute all the eigenvalues of a Laplacian pair (A, B) located inside [1.5, 2.5], where A is discretized on an N1*N2*N3 grid and B is discretized on an (N1*N2*N3)*1*1 grid with four slices:
