This directory  contains drivers for testing  a few routines
for computing eigenvalues of general sparse (symmetric real)
matrices. 

Spcifically these are testing [P]olynomial filtering [Lan]czos
[R]estarting spectrum slicing.

LapPLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make LapPLanR.ex --> executable LapPLanR.ex


MMPLanR_omp.c : 
    same as MMPlanR.c but with openMP
    parallelization across slices
    make MMPLanR_omp.ex--> executable MMPLanR_omp.ex

          MatrixFormat: coordinate format (matrix market format)
            MM0: matrix format indexing starts at 0 
            MM1: matrix format indexing starts at 1
          a, b : interval [a, b] of interest
          nslices: number of slices for spectrum slicing

The computed eigenvalues are saved in OUT/ folder. 
 
Run:

./MM*.ex 

To compute all the eigenvalues of a Laplacian discretized on
an N1*N2*N3  grid, located in  the interval [D1, D2]  with K
slices:

./Lap*.ex -nx N1 -ny N2 -nz N3 -a D1 -b D2 -nslices K
