This  directory  contains  drivers  for testing  a  few  routines  for
computing eigenvalues of general sparse (symmetric real) matrices.

Specifically these are for testing  the subspace iteration method with
spectrum slicing.

Lap_: Generate laplacian matrices
MM: Read from matrix market file.


LapPSI.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Subspace Iteration
    make LapPSI.ex --> executable LapPSI.ex

          MatrixFormat: coordinate format (matrix market format)
            MM0: matrix format indexing starts at 0 
            MM1: matrix format indexing starts at 1
          a, b : interval [a, b] of interest
          nslices: number of slices for spectrum slicing

The computed eigenvalues are saved in OUT/ folder. 

To compute all the eigenvalues of a Laplacian discretized on
an N1*N2*N3  grid, located in  the interval [D1, D2]  with K
slices:

./Lap*.ex -nx N1 -ny N2 -nz N3 -a D1 -b D2 -nslices K

 
Run:

./MM*.ex
